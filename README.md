# Tickle Pickle
Submission for the tickle pickle challenge

Here we were given two different files [client.py](https://github.com/Sainya-Ranakshetram-Submission/tickle-pickle/blob/master/default_unedited_code/client.py) and [server.py](https://github.com/Sainya-Ranakshetram-Submission/tickle-pickle/blob/master/default_unedited_code/server.py)
and here is the problem statement,
```
- Find out what the vulnerability is.
- Create a exploit code so that you can exploit the working of the application.
- Modify both the files in such a way that the application is no more vulnerarble.
```
